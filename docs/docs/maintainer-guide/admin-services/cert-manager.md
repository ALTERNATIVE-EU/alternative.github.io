# Cert-manager

## Overview

Cert-manager is a crucial component of the ALTERNATIVE platform's security infrastructure, responsible for automating the management of SSL/TLS certificates. This powerful tool ensures that all communications within and to the platform remain encrypted and secure, playing a vital role in maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Certificate Management**: Cert-manager handles the entire lifecycle of SSL/TLS certificates, from issuance to renewal, without manual intervention.

2. **Integration with Let's Encrypt**: Leverages the free, automated, and open Certificate Authority to provide trusted certificates.

3. **Kubernetes Native**: Designed to work seamlessly within the Kubernetes ecosystem, aligning with the platform's cloud-native architecture.

4. **Support for Multiple Issuers**: While primarily configured with Let's Encrypt, cert-manager can work with various certificate issuers.

5. **Certificate Rotation**: Automatically handles certificate rotation before expiration, ensuring continuous secure communication.

## How Cert-manager Works

1. **Certificate Request**: When a new service is deployed or a certificate is near expiration, cert-manager detects the need for a new certificate.

2. **ACME Challenge**: Utilizes the ACME protocol to prove control over the domain to Let's Encrypt.

3. **Certificate Issuance**: Once validated, Let's Encrypt issues the certificate, which cert-manager then stores as a Kubernetes secret.

4. **Distribution**: The certificate is automatically distributed to the relevant services and ingress controllers.

5. **Monitoring and Renewal**: Cert-manager continuously monitors certificate expiration dates and initiates the renewal process when necessary.

## Benefits for the ALTERNATIVE Platform

- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures all platform communications are encrypted, protecting sensitive research data.
- **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: Eliminates the need for manual certificate management, freeing up resources for core platform development.
- **Scalability**: Easily manages certificates for multiple services and domains as the platform grows.
- **Compliance**: Helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations by ensuring data in transit is always encrypted.

## Configuration and Management

Cert-manager is configured declaratively through Kubernetes custom resources:

- **Issuer/ClusterIssuer**: Defines how cert-manager should request certificates.
- **Certificate**: Describes the desired X.509 certificate.
- **CertificateRequest**: A one-shot request for a certificate, typically managed automatically.

Administrators can monitor cert-manager's operations through Kubernetes logs and events, ensuring smooth operation of this critical security component.
