## Ingress Controller

The platform employs an **NGINX-based ingress controller** to manage and route ingress traffic to the appropriate internal services. This controller acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer, handling incoming HTTP/S requests and directing them based on URL paths and other criteria. The ingress controller is a critical component for managing external access to the platform's services, providing a secure and efficient gateway for incoming traffic.

Each of these administrative services plays a vital role in the overall functionality and security of the **ALTERNATIVE** platform. They are configured and maintained to ensure optimal performance, security compliance, and seamless integration with other platform components. All of the administrative services are deployed and run on top of Kubernetes.
