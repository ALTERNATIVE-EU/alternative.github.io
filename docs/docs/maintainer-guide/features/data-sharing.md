# Data sharing

## Overview

The ALTERNATIVE platform facilitates secure data sharing and exchange between authorized users and groups through its comprehensive access control capabilities. All datasets and resources uploaded to the platform can be assigned granular permissions, specifying which users or organizations are allowed to view, access for analysis, edit metadata, or delete the assets entirely.

Flexible organization hierarchies allow reflective sharing permissions, such as a folder visible to members of a specific department, or an analytics project workspace shared between different users collaborating tightly. Access requests can also be configured for privileged approvals before enabling wider dataset visibility.

Published open data is made publicly findable and accessible to all CKAN visitors. Private data restricted to members of the same group or organization can be easily shared for collaboration scenarios with audit logs tracking all access. Restricted datasets also benefit from CKAN features like ratings/comments, metadata enhancements, and discussions while remaining protected.

### Metadata

Metadata helps organize, find, and understand information better, acting as a helpful guide that tells you what you need to know about the stuff you're looking at or working with. The Platform provides a powerful metadata functionality, including default fields, custom fields and metadata extension for scientific experiments.

#### Default Metadata Fields

#### Advanced Metadata for Experiments
 Because the project and datasets specifics related to experiment data, predefined metadata fields were implemented. When creating or editing a dataset a checkbox located above the custom metadata fields is available to show these extra fields.

  | name                  | description                                                                                                                               |

#### Custom Metadata Fields
 Storing additional metadata for a dataset beyond the default metadata is a common use case. The ALTERNATIVE platform provides a simple way to do this by allowing you to store arbitrary key/value pairs against a dataset when creating or updating the dataset. These appear under the “Advanced metadata for experiments” section on the web interface and in the ‘extras’ field of the JSON when accessed via the API.
