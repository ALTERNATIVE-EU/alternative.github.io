# Elasticity

## Overview

Elasticity is a cornerstone feature of the ALTERNATIVE platform's cloud infrastructure. It refers to the ability of the system to dynamically adjust its resource allocation in response to changing demands, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

## Key Aspects of Elasticity

### 1. On-Demand Provisioning

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Services can be provisioned instantly as needed.

### 2. Scalability

- **Vertical Scaling**: Ability to increase or decrease the power of individual resources.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Capability to add or remove instances of resources.

### 3. Adaptability

- **Workload Fluctuations**: The infrastructure adapts to varying computational demands.
- **Project Evolution**: Easily accommodates changes in project requirements over time.

## Benefits of Elasticity in ALTERNATIVE

1. **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for the resources you use, avoiding over-provisioning.
2. **Performance Enhancement**: Maintain responsiveness during peak demand periods.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Automatically scale down during low-usage periods.
4. **Future-Proofing**: Easily adapt to new technologies and methodologies as the project evolves.

## Implementation in ALTERNATIVE

- **Cloud Provider Services**: Utilizes native cloud services for elastic compute and storage resources.

## Use Cases

1. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Automatically scale computational resources for large-scale data analysis tasks.
2. **User Traffic Spikes**: Seamlessly handle increased user activity during collaborative sessions or data uploads.
