# Endpoints

This document provides comprehensive API documentation, ensuring developers have all the necessary information for successful integration.


## OpenAPI (Swagger) Specification
Interactive documentation for all endpoints is available through our OpenAPI (Swagger) Specification. This allows for easy testing and exploration of the API capabilities. Access the interactive documentation [here](https://ai-ml-api.platform.alternative-project.eu/swagger). To use it first you need [to generate an access token](https://alternative-eu.github.io/alternative.github.io/user-services/ai-ml-api/token-management/token-lifecycle/#obtaining-tokens). Then in swagger you need to enter your token in the top right corner by clicking on Authorize button, then enter your token in the field provided in the format `Bearer <token>`.

## Versioning
We use semantic versioning for our API to ensure backward compatibility and clear communication of changes. Each endpoint's version and deprecation schedules are documented. 

## Detailed Error Messages
Our API provides detailed error messages to help developers troubleshoot issues quickly.

## Health Check Endpoint
A health check endpoint is available to monitor the status of the API server. This endpoint can be used to verify that the server is running and responsive.
