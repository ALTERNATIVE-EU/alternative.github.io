# Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented in our system. It covers the token-based security mechanism using an Envoy filter, integration with Keycloak for identity and access management, and the application of Role-based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained permissions.

## Token-based Security Mechanism

The system employs a robust token-based security mechanism integrated within the Istio service mesh. This approach ensures that only authenticated and authorized requests can access protected services.

### Implementation Details

- **Envoy Filter**: A custom HTTP filter deployed as a sidecar container alongside the service it secures. It performs the following functions:
  - **Request Interception**: All incoming requests are intercepted for validation.
  - **Token Validation**: Validates the JWT token's signature and checks the token ID against a revocation list stored in a PostgreSQL database.
  - **Caching**: To improve performance and reduce database queries, caching is used for the token's revocation status and the public key for signature verification.

### Verification Process

1. **Extract Token**: The token is extracted from the request header.
2. **Validate Structure and Signature**: Checks if the token structure is valid and verifies the signature.
3. **Check Expiration**: Ensures the token has not expired.
4. **Verify Claims**: Verifies the issuer and audience claims.
5. **Revocation List Check**: Checks the token ID against a revocation list.

## Keycloak Integration

Keycloak serves as the central identity and access management system, offering features like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect support, and multi-factor authentication.

### Integration Steps

1. **Realm Configuration**: Set up a Keycloak realm specific to the API.
2. **Client Application Setup**: Register the client application in Keycloak.
3. **Roles and Permissions**: Define roles and permissions for access control.
4. **Token Configuration**: Configure token settings, including lifespan and signature algorithm.
5. **Library Integration**: Integrate Keycloak libraries with the Envoy filter for seamless authentication and authorization.

## Access Control

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to provide fine-grained access control to API endpoints. This section could be expanded with examples of role definitions and how they are applied to endpoints.

### Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Roles**: Ensure roles and permissions are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in access requirements.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Token Validation Failure**: Ensure the token has not expired and the signature matches the public key.
- **Access Denied**: Verify the user's roles and permissions align with the requested resource's access control policies.
- **Performance Issues**: Check the caching mechanism for token validation and revocation status to ensure it is functioning correctly.
