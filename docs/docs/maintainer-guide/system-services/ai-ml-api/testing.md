# Testing
We have written comprehensive unit tests for the API server, covering a wide range of scenarios and edge cases. It includes the following:

- **Test Cases**: Detailed test cases for each API endpoint.
- **Coverage**: Ensuring high test coverage to validate the functionality of the API.
- **Automation**: Implementing automated testing to streamline the testing process.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrating testing into the CI/CD pipeline for efficient development.
- **Mocking**: Using mocks to simulate external dependencies and ensure isolated testing.
- **Performance Testing**: Conducting performance tests to evaluate the API's responsiveness and scalability.
