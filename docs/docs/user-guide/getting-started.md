# Getting started

This user guide provides instructions for using the Data Management Platform’s web interface to organize, publish, and discover data. In addition to the web interface, the platform offers a robust API that facilitates the development of extensions and integration with other information systems.

The platform also integrates JupyterHub, which enables users to interact with datasets and perform computations within isolated virtual environments. JupyterHub provides a familiar notebook-based interface suitable for data analysis, preprocessing, and exploratory tasks.

This guide also provides instructions for end users on how to work with the integrated AI/ML models available on the platform. It covers how to access the models, submit data for processing, and interpret the results, all through a simplified and intuitive interface—no programming or technical expertise is required.
